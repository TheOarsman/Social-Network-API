## Description

Developers, ever tasked with integrating third-party APIs, can now effortlessly access weather data for cities with this browser-based weather dashboard. Leveraging the [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5), this dashboard dynamically updates HTML and CSS, providing users with accurate and up-to-date weather information.

Utilizing localStorage, the dashboard ensures persistent data storage, maintaining user preferences and settings across sessions.
